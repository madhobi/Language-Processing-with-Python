# Language-Processing-with-Python
Here, I am working with a dataset containing medical notes. I have focused on named entity recognition (ner) task using Spacy (Python library). The dataset
is publicly available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finalepoch/medical-ner/data

In a typical workflow, text data processing requires the following steps:
- tokenization
    - split into smaller units e.g., words or characters
- standardization
    - convert all text to lowercase, remove punctuation, stopwords etc.
- numeric representation
    - index the tokens
    - map tokens to numeric vector

I have attached two notebooks here:
- In the first notebook, I did some data exploration
- In the second notebook, I used Spacy to recognize medically relevant entity.
